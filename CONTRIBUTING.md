# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to this project!


## Forms of contribution

You can contribute several ways, here are some:


### Bug reports

If you find a bug, please submit an issue. Try to be as detailed as possible to help us fix the bug. Here is a list of possible information:

 - Precise description of the bug
 - Details of your environment (for example: OS, PHP version, installed extensions)
 - Backtrace which might help identifing the bug


### Feature requests

If you think a feature is missing, please submit an issue. Try to explain your use case as fully as possible to help us understand why you think the feature should be added. If you have any resources (for example where you saw that feature) you can link them as well.


### Security reports

If you discover any security related issues, please contact us at [security@indigophp.com](mailto:security@supervisorphp.com) instead of submitting an issue on Github. This allows us to fix the issue and release a security hotfix without publicly disclosing the vulnerability.


### Pull Requests

If you want to fix a bug or implement a feature yourself, you can send a Pull Request.

Please keep the following guidelines in mind:

- **Follow [PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)**
- **Add tests!** - Our aim is at least 80% coverage. Please see the [README](README.md) and [composer.json](composer.json) for testing framework and command.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the README and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow semver. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **Create topic branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.
- **Clean commit messages** - Please write your commit messages in the imperative and follow the [guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) for clear and concise messages.
